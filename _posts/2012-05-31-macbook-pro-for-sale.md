I'm selling my 13" Macbook Pro. It is the June 2009 model. It comes with
a "second skin case", original install disk, remote and charger with 2
UK plugs.

The Specifications are as follows:

* **Model Name:** MacBook Pro
* **Model Identifier:** MacBookPro5,5
* **Processor Name:** Intel Core 2 Duo
* **Processor Speed:** 2.26 GHz
* **Number Of Processors:** 1
* **Total Number Of Cores:** 2
* **L2 Cache:** 3 MB
* **Memory:** 8 GB
* **Bus Speed:** 1.07 GHz

As you can see above, the laptop has been upgraded from the default 2GB
of RAM to a massive 8GB.

Overall the laptop is in good condition apart from one scratch. It is in
the corner of the outside on the top and can be seen in the next image.

I am asking selling all this for Â£500.

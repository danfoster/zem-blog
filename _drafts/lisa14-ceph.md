I've always been fond of [Ceph](http://ceph.com/) as an object store for both its features and it's Enterprise support model. Therefore at [LISA](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa14) I attended the [Introduction to Ceph](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa14/training-program/full-training-program#S7) training session.

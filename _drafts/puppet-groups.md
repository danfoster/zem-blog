In a previous role at work I was using [bcfg2](http://http://bcfg2.org/) to manage ~380 clients with 190 unique profiles. As I'm introducing configuration management to my current area of work, we're using [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) as our configuration management tool of choice.

As a long time [bcfg2](http://http://bcfg2.org/) user, moving to [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) has been interesting. While many of the data types and paradigms are very similar, others are not.

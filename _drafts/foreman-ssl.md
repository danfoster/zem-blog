[Foreman](http://theforeman.org/) does a great job of providing SSL support out-of-the-bo, it does this by using the SSL certificates generated by your puppet-ca. Unless your users web browsers all trust the puppet CA (unlikely), any human user of Foreman is going to get SSL warnings. Replacing Foremans SSL certifcate with one that's signed by a default trusted CA requires some care for 2 reasons:

 * Other components apart from humans using web browers, need to validate the Foreman server. Therefore we need to make sure these components validate the Forman server against the correct CA.
 * Foreman uses SSL client authentication to authenticate various components via their puppet-ca certificates. We need to make sure we do *not* change the CA that foreman uses to authenticate these components.

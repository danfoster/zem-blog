Configuration management tools make it very easy to configure a large number of
servers easily. It also means it's very easy to break a large number of servers
in one go. To minimise the latter it's important to have a robust work flow and follow best practices to be able to prevent as many negative changes from
hitting production as possible.

The following is a brain dump of useful practises. These have been written with Puppet in mind and therefore use tools and terminology related to puppet, but it should be possible to apply them to any configuration management tool.
